# Problem: Ion Thrusters to Saturn 
A spacecraft is in a circular orbit around the Earth, with an orbital period of 90 minutes.  The spacecraft has a total mass of 5,000 kg, including fuel.  The spacecraft is equipped with ion thrusters that can provide a constant thrust of 400 millinewtons, with a specific impulse of 4,000 seconds.  Our goal is to place the spacecraft into a circular orbit around Saturn, with an orbital period of 40 hours.  What is the minimum amount of fuel this will take?  What will be the duration of the trip?  How should the thrusters be controlled during the journey?

# Abstract
With the latest expanses in the electrical propulsion systems, it is now possible to think about the interplanetary
low-thrust travel with the ion thrusters. It is called low thrust because the acceleration that given by this engine’s
force is very small compared to other forces but its sustainability comes from long time usage of the engine. In this
paper, we carefully investigate the feasibility of Earth to Saturn travel only using ion thrusters. The problem is the
optimum control of the thrust to reach Saturn with the maximum mass and minimum time elapsed. After implementing
a solar system simulator we first investigate the escaping from the earth gravitational field using different methods of
thrust control and after we escape from the earth we use gravity assist from Jupiter to get faster and reach Saturn. The
propulsion system applies constant thrust in the direction of the orbital velocity to increase the semimajor axis at the
fastest rate. After the flyby to Jupiter, the thrusters are fired back to slow down so that minimizes the velocity relative to
Saturn at arrival, thus facilitating the orbit insertion. We show that with our proposed method, it’s possible to reach
Saturn in approximately 8 years with a loss of 1.3 tons of fuel. The amount of fuel we propose is feasible compared to
mass of the spaceshuttle being send
